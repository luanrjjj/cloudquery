CloudQuery requires only `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY`. Follow [this guide](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/) for how to create an API key CloudQuery.

CloudQuery requires only *read* permissions (we will never make any changes to your NewRelic account),
so, following the principle of the least privilege, it's recommended to grant it read-only permissions.
